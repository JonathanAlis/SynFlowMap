### Requirements

#### Basic Demo - with pre-processed videos
* **Numpy** - For linear algebra operations
* **OpenCV** - For optical flow and remapping
* **Random** - To set random seed at specific places where random operations take place just so it happens the same way everytime it is executed
* **Pandas** - To create DataFrame, CSV files, etc
#### Getting the DataBase
